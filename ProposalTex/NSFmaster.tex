\section{Overview}
The CORAL project consists of a hierarchical multilayer data processing system, that contains the following Levels (with reference to EOSIS [https://science.nasa.gov/earth-science/earth-science-data/data-processing-levels-for-eosdis-data-products])

Level 0 processing operates on the raw data generated from the spectroscopic instrument. As is commonplace with legacy hardware, sensitivity measurements are recorded in a range of different file formats that contains instrument specific details. A significant amount of time must be invested by the researcher to process these configuration files in order to generate data that can then be used in the context of the research. A system must be created that can efficiently extract data across various configuration formats, and consolidate the information to create datasets containing a higher degree of coherency.
